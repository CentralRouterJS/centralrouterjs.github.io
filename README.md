## About the project

Maybe you got the question: what is CentralRouter?

It's a learning project for me, and I'd like to discover more-and-more features from NodeJS.
While I'm building this, I'm going to work around a DDN which stands for "Data Delivery Network" 
based on a personal idea to access data from private networks without opening a port for a service, 
touching a firewall.
